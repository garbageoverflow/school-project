# Just another shitty school project

So basically we had to do a shitty project for school, i didn't take it seriously. It was about securty things. At first I wanted to steal the credentials of my teacher(wich isn't really good with computers) as a joke. I abandoned that idea when i learned that hacking can be punished by law.

It was made in a hurry and, at the end, it coudn't help people that didn't even know what OS I used. <br>
I just posted it here, because the school didn't even grade it.

It was made using MarkDown, you can view it using specialized MarkDown Viewers or just like me, use an vs-code/atom extension.
